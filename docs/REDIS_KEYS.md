## Key Definitions

### State Tracker Keys

#### Active Epoch Management
- `ActiveEpochs()` - SET: Currently active epoch IDs

```

### 2. Level 1 Aggregation with Monitoring (Worker Parts → Local Batch)

### 9. Active Epochs Query Flow (Fixed Implementation)
```
Monitor API: GET /epochs/active

3. **Persistent**: Namespaced by protocol/market (e.g., `{protocol}:{market}:processed:{id}`)
4. **Communication**: Direction prefix (e.g., `incoming:`, `outgoing:`)
5. **Status**: Component:metric format (e.g., `pipeline:health:{component}`)
6. **Monitoring**: `metrics:{type}:timeline` for event tracking
7. **Deterministic**: `ActiveEpochs`, `Epoch*` for direct access patterns

## TTL Guidelines

### Core Data Flow
- **Temporary processing**: 5 minutes
- **Window status**: 1 hour after close
- **Incoming batches**: 30 minutes
- **Finalized batches**: 24 hours minimum
- **Aggregated batches**: Persistent (no TTL)
- **Active validators**: 5 minutes

### Monitoring & Metrics
- **Dashboard summary**: 60 seconds (real-time metrics)
- **Current stats**: 60 seconds (same as dashboard summary)
- **Participation metrics**: 5 minutes (24h calculations less frequent)
- **Current epoch status**: 30 seconds (frequent updates)
- **Timeline events**: No TTL (pruned daily by state-tracker)
- **Validator batch timelines**: No TTL (pruned daily by state-tracker)
- **Batch validator lists**: 24 hours (participation tracking)
- **Health status**: 5 minutes (component monitoring)

### Pruning Strategy

#### Timeline Pruning (CRITICAL)
State-tracker prunes the following timeline zsets daily (removes entries older than 24 hours):
- `{protocol}:{market}:metrics:epochs:timeline` ✅
- `{protocol}:{market}:metrics:batches:timeline` ✅
- `{protocol}:{market}:metrics:submissions:timeline` ✅ (Fixed - was missing)
- `{protocol}:{market}:metrics:validations:timeline` ✅ (Fixed - was missing)

**Note**: If pruning fails, these zsets will grow unbounded. Monitor key sizes and alert if they exceed 1M members.

#### ActiveEpochs SET Pruning
The `{protocol}:{market}:epochs:active` SET is pruned periodically by state-tracker to remove epochs older than 7 days. This prevents unbounded growth when TTL keeps getting refreshed.

**TTL Behavior**: 
- TTL is only refreshed when adding NEW epochs (not when epoch already exists)
- Event monitor checks if epoch was actually added before refreshing TTL
- P2P gateway only sets TTL if missing (doesn't refresh on every add)
- The set has a 24-hour TTL as a safety net, but relies on periodic pruning for cleanup

#### Legacy Queue Cleanup
The `{protocol}:{market}:aggregation:queue` LIST is a legacy structure that is not used by the active aggregation system (which uses Redis streams instead). 

**Automated Cleanup**: State-tracker automatically deletes this queue if it exceeds 10K items to prevent unbounded growth. The cleanup script will also warn about it if it exceeds the threshold.

#### Size Monitoring
State-tracker monitors Redis key sizes and logs warnings if they exceed thresholds:
- **ZSETs**: Alert if > 1M members
- **SETs**: Alert if > 100K members
- **LISTs**: Alert if > 10K items

### Deterministic Sets
- **ActiveEpochs**: Pruned periodically (removes epochs older than 7 days)
- **EpochValidators**: Managed per epoch, cleaned up with epoch state
- **EpochSubmissionsIds**: Managed per epoch, cleaned up with epoch state

### Metrics Aggregation
State-tracker manages rolling windows for metrics aggregation. Timeline keys are the source of truth and must be pruned regularly.

  - Pruned by: Spam Aggregator (periodically removes expired windows - windows expire when their peers set TTL expires after 2 hours)
  - TTL: None (persistent index, pruned when windows expire)
  - Purpose: **Master index** of all windows that have spam reports - enables window discovery without knowing window IDs

### Global Flagged State (Redis Cache - synced from on-chain, TTL: 24 hours)

**Flagged Peers**:
- `{protocol}:{market}:spam:consensus_flagged:peer:{peerID}` - String (JSON) - PRIMARY
  - Written by: Flagging Service (after consensus reached, synced from on-chain)

- `flagged_peers:{dataMarket}` - SET (peer IDs) - NEW
  - Written by: Flagging Service (synced from on-chain)
  - Read by: P2P Gateway, Dequeuer (for quick lookup)

  - Read by: Spam Aggregator (to calculate consensus threshold)
  - TTL: 5 minutes (presence heartbeat)
  - Purpose: Track active validators for consensus threshold calculation

### On-Chain State (Permanent - source of truth)

**Contract Storage**:
- Protocol contract: `flaggedPeers(bytes peerID) → FlaggedPeer`
  - Stores peer ID, associated snapshotter addresses, first/last flagged epochs, timestamp
  - Permanent until cleared via contract method
  - Source of truth for flagged state

- Protocol contract: `snapshotterToPeer(address snapshotter) → bytes peerID`
  - Maps snapshotter address to peer ID
  - Used for reverse lookup

**Clearing Mechanism**:
- Time-based: Clear entries where `flaggedAt + SPAM_FLAG_EXPIRY_DAYS < now` (default: 7 days)
- Epoch-based: Clear entries where `lastFlaggedEpoch + SPAM_FLAG_EXPIRY_EPOCHS < currentEpoch` (default: 100 epochs)
- Manual: Admin function to clear specific peers/addresses

### State Synchronization

**On Node Startup**:
1. Query on-chain contract for all flagged peers
2. Populate Redis cache with flagged peer and snapshotter keys
3. Update flagged sets (`flagged_peers:{dataMarket}`, `flagged_snapshotters:{dataMarket}`)
4. Set cache TTL: 24 hours

**Periodic Sync** (every `SPAM_SYNC_INTERVAL_HOURS`):
1. Query on-chain contract for changes since last sync
2. Update Redis cache with new/changed flagged peers
3. Remove cleared peers from Redis cache
4. Refresh TTL on existing cache entries

**Cache Refresh Strategy**:
- On startup: Full sync from on-chain
- Periodic: Incremental sync (check for new flags)
- On flagging event: Immediate sync after on-chain update
- Fallback: If Redis cache miss, query on-chain contract directly

### Key Usage by Component

**P2P Gateway**:
- Reads: `{protocol}:{market}:spam:consensus_flagged:peer:{peerID}`, `flagged_peers:{dataMarket}`
- Purpose: Early rejection of submissions from flagged peers (before queuing)

**Dequeuer**:
- Writes: All per-epoch tracking keys (validation failures, submission counts, peer-snapshotter maps)
- Reads: `{protocol}:{market}:spam:consensus_flagged:peer:{peerID}`, `{protocol}:{market}:spam:consensus_flagged:snapshotter:{snapshotterAddr}`, `flagged_peers:{dataMarket}`, `flagged_snapshotters:{dataMarket}`
- Purpose: Track spam behavior, enforce rate limits, reject flagged peers/snapshotters

**Spam Reporter**:
- Writes: `{protocol}:{market}:spam:report:sent:reporter:{reporterID}:peer:{peerID}:epoch:{epochID}:reason:{reason}`
- Reads: Per-epoch tracking keys (to check thresholds)
- Purpose: Broadcast spam reports when thresholds exceeded

**Spam Aggregator**:
- Writes: `{protocol}:{market}:spam:reports:peer:{peerID}:window:{windowID}`, `{protocol}:{market}:spam:reports:window:{windowID}:peers` (SET), `{protocol}:{market}:spam:reports:windows` (master set)
- Reads: Aggregated report keys, window peers set (`{protocol}:{market}:spam:reports:window:{windowID}:peers`), master windows set (`{protocol}:{market}:spam:reports:windows`), `{protocol}:{market}:active:validators`
- Purpose: Aggregate reports from multiple validators, check consensus, trigger flagging

**Flagging Service**:
- Writes: All flagged state keys (peer, snapshotter, sets)
- Reads: On-chain contract (source of truth)
- Purpose: Flag peers on-chain, sync state to Redis cache

### TTL Management

- **Per-epoch keys**: 24 hours TTL (set on first increment)
- **Aggregation window keys**: 2 hours TTL (set on first report)
- **Flagged state cache**: 24 hours TTL (refreshed on sync)
- **On-chain state**: Permanent (no TTL, cleared via contract methods)
- **Active validators**: 5 minutes TTL (presence heartbeat)

All counters set TTL on first increment to prevent unbounded growth.

## Manual Redis Key Cleanup

When Redis memory usage is high or keys accumulate beyond expected thresholds, use the cleanup script to remove old keys.

### Cleanup Script: `cleanup_old_redis_keys.py`

**Location**: `scripts/cleanup_old_redis_keys.py`

**Purpose**: 
- Clean up old Redis keys to prevent memory bloat
- Supports epoch-based cleanup (requires protocol/market) and time-based cleanup (works without protocol/market)
- Handles multiple protocol:market combinations automatically

**Why Protocol/Market is Needed**:
- Epoch-based keys are namespaced: `{protocol}:{market}:epoch:{epochId}:...`
- To determine what's "old", we need the current epoch
- Current epoch is stored in Redis keys that require protocol/market to access
- Queue/stream/timeline cleanup can work without protocol/market (they're time-based, not epoch-based)

### Common Cleanup Scenarios

#### 1. Discovery Mode (No Cleanup)
Scan all keys to see what exists:

```bash
python3 scripts/cleanup_old_redis_keys.py --discover
```

This shows:
- Total keys by type
- Large queues (>1000 items)
- Large timelines (>10000 entries)
- All protocol:market combinations found

#### 2. Clean Queues/Streams (No Protocol/Market Needed)
For legacy queues or streams that have accumulated:

```bash
# Dry run first
python3 scripts/cleanup_old_redis_keys.py --cleanup-queues --queue-max-length 1000 --dry-run

# Actually clean
python3 scripts/cleanup_old_redis_keys.py --cleanup-queues --queue-max-length 1000

# Clean streams
python3 scripts/cleanup_old_redis_keys.py --cleanup-streams --stream-max-length 10000 --dry-run
python3 scripts/cleanup_old_redis_keys.py --cleanup-streams --stream-max-length 10000
```

#### 3. Clean Non-Namespaced Timelines (No Protocol/Market Needed)
For non-namespaced timeline keys like `metrics:submissions:timeline`:

```bash
# Dry run
python3 scripts/cleanup_old_redis_keys.py --keep-hours 24 --dry-run

# Actually clean (keeps last 24 hours)
python3 scripts/cleanup_old_redis_keys.py --keep-hours 24
```

#### 4. Clean ALL Markets Automatically (No Protocol/Market Needed)
After refactoring with multiple markets support, clean all protocol:market combinations:

```bash
# Dry run - discovers all markets automatically
python3 scripts/cleanup_old_redis_keys.py --all-markets --keep-hours 24 --cleanup-queues --dry-run

# Actually clean all markets
python3 scripts/cleanup_old_redis_keys.py --all-markets --keep-hours 24 --cleanup-queues
```

This will:
- Discover all protocol:market combinations
- Clean timeline entries older than 24 hours
- Clean legacy queues
- Remove old epoch-based keys

#### 5. Clean Specific Protocol/Market (Requires Protocol/Market)
For epoch-based cleanup of a specific protocol:market:

```bash
# Dry run
python3 scripts/cleanup_old_redis_keys.py --keep-epochs 60 --protocol 0x1234... --market 0x5678... --dry-run

# Actually clean (keeps last 60 epochs)
python3 scripts/cleanup_old_redis_keys.py --keep-epochs 60 --protocol 0x1234... --market 0x5678...
```

### Cleanup Options

- `--discover`: Scan all keys and show what exists (no cleanup)
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be deleted without actually deleting
- `--keep-epochs N`: Keep last N epochs (default: 60)
- `--keep-hours N`: Keep last N hours of timeline data (overrides --keep-epochs for timelines)
- `--cleanup-queues`: Clean up Redis LIST queues (trim to max length)
- `--cleanup-streams`: Clean up Redis streams (trim to max length)
- `--queue-max-length N`: Maximum length for queues after cleanup (default: 1000)
- `--stream-max-length N`: Maximum length for streams after cleanup (default: 10000)
- `--all-markets`: Clean up keys for all protocol:market combinations found
- `--protocol ADDRESS`: Protocol state contract address
- `--market ADDRESS`: Data market contract address
- `--host HOST`: Redis host (default: localhost)
- `--port PORT`: Redis port (default: 6380)
- `--db DB`: Redis database (default: 0)

### When to Run Cleanup

**Regular Maintenance**:
- Run `--discover` weekly to check key counts
- Run `--all-markets --keep-hours 24` monthly to clean old data

**Memory Pressure**:
- If Redis memory usage is high, run `--all-markets --keep-hours 6 --cleanup-queues --cleanup-streams`
- Check discovery results first to identify what's consuming memory

**After Refactoring**:
- After multi-market refactoring, run `--all-markets` to clean up old keys
- After timeline pruning fixes, run `--keep-hours 24` to clean accumulated non-namespaced timelines

### Troubleshooting

**Script hangs during cleanup**:
- Large timeline deletions (>100K entries) use batch processing
- This is normal and may take several minutes
- The script shows progress with batch counts

**"Protocol and market required" error**:
- Use `--all-markets` to discover and clean all markets automatically
- Or use `--keep-hours` for time-based cleanup without protocol/market
- Or use `--cleanup-queues`/`--cleanup-streams` for queue/stream cleanup

**Timeline not being cleaned**:
- Ensure state-tracker is running (it prunes timelines daily)
- Run manual cleanup with `--keep-hours 24` to clean accumulated entries
- Check if timeline is namespaced (`{protocol}:{market}:metrics:...`) or non-namespaced (`metrics:...`)
